# 🍽️ Flutter Recipes App 

This project is a **Recipes App** that replicates the design provided in the attached Figma file [Figma Design - Recipes App](https://www.figma.com/design/NLdRsBpwJgHfSmXJq2i4a1/Recipes-App-(Community)?node-id=156-0&p=f&t=R5WBS1mIYbJyNTdW-0), implementing its functionality using the BLoC state management pattern. The app allows users to add new recipes, save them to favorites, and remove them, with all logic managed through BLoC to maintain a clean separation between the UI and business logic.
